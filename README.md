# **Data Structures and Algorithms Practice** üìöüíª

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice solutions, implemented in **Java**. It covers a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, recursion, and more. Each folder or file contains solutions to different types of DSA problems to enhance problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.
